OVERALL
**********************************

    Basically, when fed a list of documents and the categories these files belong to, this program will use a
Naive-Bayes word frequency method to model the categories. This model can then be applied to identify documents of
unknown categories.

    This is a simple package for document classification using a Naive-Bayes scheme (fairly well documented, so I won't
describe it here). The main package is fairly independent of I/O, but does require a list of files, a dictionary of
the format { filename : true category }, and a dictionary of the format { filename : list of all words in file} (See
CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION-Optimization).

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION-File I/O
**********************************
    In its current state, this python file is set up to run with the command:

    python naivebayes.py -d directory

where directory is a directory of the format:

    directory
        +-category1
        |   +files in category1
        |   +...
        |
        +cateogry2
        |   +files in category2
        |   +...
        |
        +...

    This is designed to match the dataset included with this git, and available at
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/Pabo/movie-review-data/ . Please note that the categories are determined with each run,
and are not limited to the 'pos' and 'neg' categories in this example data set.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION-Optimization
**********************************
    In order to maximize average correct identification, there are a few modifications on the general Naive-Bayes format.
In particular, some words are re-weighted in bhUtilities.splitAndCleanString(), and known negative and positive words
are added in naivebayes.train().

    Additionally, I've done some work to reduce run time. In my implementation, reading files was a major bottleneck, so
I simply pickle a dictionary containing all words contained in every document. This is not realistic for larger
databases (and you should probably look into mmap or just reading documents when they are needed).

    Finally, all categories recieve equal probability in this implementation. This can be changed by modifying:
    P_c = float(len(catList))**-1 #equal weighting
